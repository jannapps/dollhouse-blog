layout: two-column-content
title: Two Columns of Content

---section: right---

# Right Column First!

This is actually the **right column** content, but I'm writing it first because I felt like it! The beauty of named sections is that **order doesn't matter**.

## Why This Matters

When creating complex layouts, you might want to:

1. **Write the conclusion first** (right column) while ideas are fresh
2. **Reference other sections** during writing
3. **Reorganize content** without changing layout
4. **Collaborate** with others on different sections

This system supports all of these workflows naturally!

### Technical Note

Each section is parsed separately and rendered as markdown, then placed into the appropriate layout position. The layout template handles the visual arrangement.

---section: left---

# Left Column Content

This is the **left column** content. Notice how I wrote the right column content first in the file, but it still appears in the correct position on the page.

## Features of This Approach

- ✅ **Flexible ordering** - Write sections in any order
- ✅ **Named sections** - Clear, semantic section names  
- ✅ **Multiple content areas** - Not limited to main + widgets
- ✅ **Pure markdown** - Each section is just normal markdown
